# Emerald

To build emerald for tomcat deployment run `./lein ring uberwar`

## Configuration

The configuration settings for the project can be found in `profiles.clj`
When the server is built using `./lein ring uberwar` the settings from :profiles/prod are pulled

| Property | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **dbspec** | should have the correct credentials for the postgres database. for details see [kormasql][1] |
| **jdbc-uri** | is the jdbc uri used by the migrations in emerald, currently migrations are run using `./lein run migrate` however these migrations are only for testing |
| **couchbase** | if false, a in memory store will be used instead of couchbase to manage both sessions, and oauth tokens. Switch to true only if a couchbase instance has been properly configured |
| **couchbase-uri** | the uri for the instance of couchbase, currently set to point at `127.0.0.1:11211` for details see [spyglass][2]|
| **auth** | false disables authentication for the routes and user context, so routes depending on the current user id will not work. Eg. `/campaign/:id/pin` |

  If the auth flag is enabled, the server expects a header containing `authorization: access_token` or a query parameter of `api_key=access_token`
